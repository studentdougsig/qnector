The goal of this Android application project is to do the following:

1) Parse through a circuit schematic (XML file) and structure the data from the nets (connections that can be between 2+ nodes) defined by the schematic author

2) Allow the user to select where they want to place nodes on a virtual breadboard (displayed on app)

3) The app connects the user-placed nodes so the circuit matches the connections of the original schematic. The app displays the suggested wire locations on the app.

4) Now, the user is able to connect their circuit on a breadboard by following the connections displayed on the app.
